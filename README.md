Step 1: put a input file named "test_input.txt" in the same directory as apriori.py. "test_input.txt" has first line as minimum support threshhold, and rest of each line represents an transaction. 

Step 2: in console run "python apriori.py"

Then in test_output.txt, there are 3 consecutive parts:  <br />
part 1: the frequent itemsets <br />
part 2: the closed itemsets <br />
part 3: the maximal itemsets
